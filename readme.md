# Amazon.com search input keyboard shortcut

Annoyed with having to manually click/ tab to the search input field on amazon.com? This extension overwrites the cmd+s shortcut from saving the html of the webpage to focusing the search input field instead


## Issues

currently only works on Mac since I made this for myself and that's all I use these days
